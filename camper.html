        <h3>Signing up</h3>
        <p>
          Camp Casey prides itself on being free for everyone of all needs. To sign up please go to our contact page 
          and reach out. We maintain a 1-1 camper counsler ratio and we typically have 60 spots available. If you have 
          any questions or concerns let us know. Casey is a camp for people with primarily physical disabilities but we
          support people with secondary mental disabilities. We are not designed for people with exclusively mental disabilities
          and if during the week your child proves to be to disruptive we will need to send them home.

        <h3>Accomodations</h3>
        <p>
          At Camp Casey we strive to accomodate all campers. Our camp barracks are wheel chair and power chair accessible. All bathrooms 
          and other camper facilities are also fully camper accessible. Our kitchen is able to meet any dietry restrictions 
          and needs, if your child struggles to eat by themselves or is fully dependent we are capable of assisting. 
          Counslers will always be on duty within the barracks including during the night. All counslers are trained in 
          Bullying and Sexaul Assault prevention. We have a highly qualified nursing staff on 24 hour stand by in the event
          of an emergency.
