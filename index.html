          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Kiwanis Camp Casey is a week long summer camp for children ages 6-17 who have physical disabilities. 
            It is provided by the North Central of Seattle Kiwanis Club and all staffing, nurses, and counselors 
            volunteer to help create “the best week of the year” for our campers. Camp is now being held at Lions 
            Camp Horizon in Blaine, WA. Transportation to and from Camp is provided from the North Seattle area. 
            For over 75 years the Seattle North Central Kiwanis 
            Club has fully funded the camp, so it is free of charge! Continue on to learn more about Casey.

          <h3>Get Involved</h3>
          <p>
            Volunteers are crucial to camp running smoothly. While counselors ages 16 through college age provide all 
            direct camper care, we rely on our volunteers ages 18+ to setup and cleanup, help out in the mess hall, keep 
            campers and counselors safe, assist with laundry, arts-and-crafts, and night-watch. 
            We are looking for much-needed volunteers interested in helping provide campers the best week of their life!

            or have any questions send an email to: headcounselors@campcasey.org if you would like to be a part of Camp Casey 
            in the future.

            "Camp Casey is a place where I am looked at not as “the girl with the disability” or “the girl who walks weird”
            but instead, I am 
            looked at as Maria." 
                - <em>Maria, age 14</em>

            "Camp Casey is very special to me because no one judges anybody here. Everyone has a different definition of 
            home, but when we come to Camp Casey all of us feel like we are at home."
